One major application is the use of organic fruits and vegetables, which are preferred for their reduced exposure to synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. Consumers are increasingly aware of the benefits of organic produce, leading to a rise in demand for these items in both domestic and international markets. This trend is supported by a growing number of supermarkets and specialty stores dedicated to offering organic fruits and vegetables, enhancing their availability and accessibility to consumers. Additionally, the increasing emphasis on farm-to-table dining experiences has further propelled the demand for fresh, organic produce, reflecting a broader shift towards more transparent and sustainable food sourcing practices.</p><p>Another key application within the natural and organic food market is the demand for organic dairy products and meat. Consumers are becoming more discerning about the quality and origin of their food, leading to a heightened preference for organic dairy items such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. These products are valued for their lack of artificial hormones and antibiotics, aligning with a growing interest in health and wellness. Similarly, organic meat products are gaining traction as they promise better animal welfare and reduced exposure to chemicals. The rise in organic meat consumption is also influenced by increasing awareness of the environmental impact of conventional meat production.
